# CSC Work Group Project Repo, 2022-23
This repository will house the code developed in coursework by UniCross students of the Department of Computer Science for the course CSC 3105 (Object-Oriented Programming) for the 2022/23 Session.
## Folders
The code folder will hold all programs written by each firm and its groups. The code folder will have 6 subfolders, each one about a separate corporation/firm.
Each of these will, in turn, have 6 subfolders, with each group's work in its corresponding folder, i.e. Group 13 will commit the work assigned to them to the Group 13 folder, over the life of the project.

The firms and the groups are listed below:
|Firm|Groups Under Firm|
| ----------- | ----------- |
|AlgoMatrix Solutions|Groups 1 through 6|
|BinaryHyWay Informatix|Groups 7 through 12|
|CodeCraft Innovations|Groups 13 through 18|
|DataDynamo Systems|Groups 19 through 24|
|Evergreen Dynamics|Groups 25 through 30|
|FutureForge Labs|Groups 31 through 36|
|Gravitek Solutions|Groups 37 through 42|
|HyperNexus|Groups 43 through 48|
|InnoByte Labs|Groups 49 through 54|
|Jetstream Technologies|Groups 55 through 60|

Firm CEOs will create these subfolders for the groups.
