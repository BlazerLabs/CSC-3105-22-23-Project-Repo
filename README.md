# CSC Work Group Project Repo, 2022-23
This repository will house the code developed in coursework by UniCross students of the Department of Computer Science for the course CSC 3105 (Object-Oriented Programming) for the 2022/23 Session.
## Folders
The code folder will hold all programs written by each firm and its groups. The code folder will have 6 subfolders, each one about a separate corporation/firm.
Each of these will, in turn, have 6 subfolders, with each group's work in its corresponding folder, i.e. Group 13 will commit the work assigned to them to the Group 13 folder, over the life of the project.

Firm CEOs will create these subfolders for the groups.
