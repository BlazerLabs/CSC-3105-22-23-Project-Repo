# Code
The files in this directory contain the code developed by **InnoByte Labs** for the 2022/23 CSC 3105 coursework.

## File System Description
_Welcome to the code file system for InnobyteLabs data structures implementations. This directory structure houses various implementations of data structures, each categorized under respective group folders._

## Folder Structure
- **Group-49**: This folder contains implementations related to Group 49's data structure projects.
- **Group-50**: Implementation files for Group 50's data structure projects are stored here.
- **Group-51**: Explore implementations for Group 51's data structure projects in this directory.
- **Group-52**: Discover Group 52's data structure implementations within this folder.
- **Group-53**: Access Group 53's data structure implementation files in this directory.
- **Group-54**: Find implementations submitted by Group 54 members for data structure projects here.
