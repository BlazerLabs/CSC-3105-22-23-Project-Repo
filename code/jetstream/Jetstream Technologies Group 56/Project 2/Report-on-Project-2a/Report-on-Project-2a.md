# Project 2
**The following is a report on the work done by JETSTREAM TECHNOLOGIES GROUP 56 on a project assigned during CSC 3105 coursework in the 2022/23 session, as follows:**

## Question
Data structures complement algorithms in the way programs work, on account of their facility for organising and enabling access to data; thus, understanding data structures is fundamental to our knowledge and use of programs, irrespective of what paradigm is in play.
a. Each group in your corporation is to identify and describe ALL data structures used in programming.

## Response

Below, is a list of data structures across different categories as worked on by all groups under JETSTREAM TECHNOLOGIES:
1. Linear Data Structures
2. Non-Linear Data Structures
3. Advanced Data Structures
4. Specialized Data Structures
5. String Data Structures


B. NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES

Overview of Non-Linear Data Structures:

In order to efficiently organize and handle data, non-linear data structures are necessary since they express complicated interactions between data items. This is a thorough rundown of a few popular non-linear data structures:

1. Trees: Made up of nodes, each of which includes a value and a list of references to its offspring nodes, trees are hierarchical data structures. Nodes without children are referred to as leaves, while the highest node is known as the root. Applications for trees can be found in many fields, including as file systems, databases, and computer science.

2. Binary Trees:
A binary tree is a special type of tree data structure in which each node has at most two children. These children are typically referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are widely used in search algorithms, expression parsing, and sorting algorithms.

3. Binary Search Trees (BST):
A binary search tree is a binary tree where the left child of each node contains values smaller than the parent node, and the right child contains values larger than the parent node. This ordering property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, making BSTs a popular choice for implementing dictionary-like data structures.

4. Heaps:
Heaps are binary tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property. Depending on the property, heaps can be classified as min-heaps or max-heaps. In a min-heap, the parent node's value is smaller than or equal to the values of its children nodes. Conversely, in a max-heap, the parent node's value is greater than or equal to the values of its children nodes. Heaps are commonly used in priority queues and heap sort algorithms.

5. Graphs:
Graphs are collections of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect certain pairs of nodes. They are versatile data structures that represent complex relationships between objects. Graphs can be directed or undirected, and they find applications in various domains, including social networks, transportation systems, and computer networks.

6. Hash Tables: Hash tables are data structures that use a hash function to link keys to values. Their O(1) average time complexity allows them to perform lookup, insertion, and deletion operations with efficiency. Implementing associative arrays, database indexing, and caching techniques are common uses for hash tables.
