# Project 2
**The following is a report on the work done by JETSTREAM TECHNOLOGIES GROUP 58 on a project assigned during CSC 3105 coursework in the 2022/23 session, as follows:**

## Question
Data structures complement algorithms in the way programs work, on account of their facility for organising and enabling access to data; thus, understanding data structures is fundamental to our knowledge and use of programs, irrespective of what paradigm is in play.

a. Each group in your corporation is to identify and describe ALL data structures used in programming.

## Response

Below, is a list of data structures across different categories as worked on by all groups under JETSTREAM TECHNOLOGIES:
1. Linear Data Structures
2. Non-Linear Data Structures
3. Advanced Data Structures
4. Specialized Data Structures
5. String Data Structures


D. SPECIALIZED DATA STRUCTURES:

Specialized Data Structures Overview:

Specialized data structures are data structures specifically designed to address unique requirements or solve particular problems efficiently. Unlike general-purpose data structures like arrays or linked lists, specialized data structures are tailored to handle specific types of data or operations more effectively. These data structures often come with built-in algorithms, optimizations, or constraints that make them suitable for specific tasks. Here's a comprehensive overview of some common specialized data structures:

1. Priority Queues: A priority queue is a queue data structure where each element has an associated priority. Elements with higher (or lower) priorities are dequeued first. Priority queues are commonly used in algorithms and applications where ordering elements by priority is essential, such as task scheduling or shortest path algorithms.

2. Bloom Filters: Bloom filters are space-efficient probabilistic data structures used to test whether an element is a member of a set. They use a set of hash functions to map elements to a bit array. While they provide fast membership tests, they may produce false positives but not false negatives. Bloom filters are useful in applications like spell checking, network routers, or duplicate detection.

3. Skip Lists: Skip lists are probabilistic data structures that provide a fast alternative to balanced trees for search, insertion, and deletion operations. They consist of multiple linked lists, each with progressively fewer elements and skipping over some elements. Skip lists are often used in scenarios where simplicity of implementation and moderate performance are desired, such as in-memory databases or concurrent data structures.

4. Spatial Data Structures: Spatial data structures are used to store and manipulate spatial data efficiently. They are designed to organize and index geometric objects in multi-dimensional space. Examples include Quad trees, which are tree data structures used to partition a two-dimensional space into smaller rectangular regions, and R-trees, which are tree data structures designed for indexing multi-dimensional information, commonly used for spatial indexing of points or rectangles.
