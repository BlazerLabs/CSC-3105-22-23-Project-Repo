**The following is a report on the work done by JETSTREAM TECHNOLOGIES GROUP 57 on a project assigned during CSC 3105 coursework in the 2022/23 session, as follows:**

## Question
Data structures complement algorithms in the way programs work, on account of their facility for organising and enabling access to data; thus, understanding data structures is fundamental to our knowledge and use of programs, irrespective of what paradigm is in play.

a. Each group in your corporation is to identify and describe ALL data structures used in programming.

## Response

Below, is a list of data structures across different categories as worked on by all groups under JETSTREAM TECHNOLOGIES:
1. Linear Data Structures
2. Non-Linear Data Structures
3. Advanced Data Structures
4. Specialized Data Structures
5. String Data Structures


C. ADVANCED DATA STRUCTURES:

Advanced Data Structures Overview:

Advanced data structures are specialized data structures that are intended to handle unique requirements or solve specific difficulties efficiently. They frequently offer enhanced features and optimizations over simple data structures. We'll look at four advanced data structures: trie, segment trees, disjoint sets (union-find), and B-trees.

1. A Trie:
A Trie is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings in a space-efficient manner. Each node of the trie represents a single character of the string. Trie is typically used for dictionary implementations, where efficient string lookups, insertions, and deletions are required.

2. Segment Trees:
A Segment Tree is a data structure used for range queries and updates over an array or list. It allows efficient querying of the sum, minimum, maximum, or any other associative function over a range of array elements. Segment trees are useful for problems involving interval-based queries.

3. Disjoint Set (Union-Find):
Disjoint Set, also known as Union-Find, is a data structure that keeps track of elements partitioned into disjoint sets. It provides two primary operations: Union, which merges two sets, and Find, which determines the set to which a given element belongs. Disjoint sets are commonly used for solving problems involving connectivity and partitioning.

4. B-trees:
A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure commonly used in databases and file systems for efficient storage and retrieval of data. It maintains sorted data and allows for quick searching, insertion, and deletion operations. B-trees are characterized by their ability to handle large amounts of data and maintain balanced structures.
