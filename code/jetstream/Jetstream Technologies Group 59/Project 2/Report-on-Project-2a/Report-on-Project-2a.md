# Project 2
**The following is a report on the work done by JETSTREAM TECHNOLOGIES GROUP 59 on a project assigned during CSC 3105 coursework in the 2022/23 session, as follows:**

## Question
Data structures complement algorithms in the way programs work, on account of their facility for organising and enabling access to data; thus, understanding data structures is fundamental to our knowledge and use of programs, irrespective of what paradigm is in play.

a. Each group in your corporation is to identify and describe ALL data structures used in programming.

## Response

Below, is a list of data structures across different categories as worked on by all groups under JETSTREAM TECHNOLOGIES:
1. Linear Data Structures
2. Non-Linear Data Structures
3. Advanced Data Structures
4. Specialized Data Structures
5. String Data Structures


E. STRING DATA STRUCTURES:

String Data Structures Overview:

String data structures refer to specialized data structures designed for efficiently storing, manipulating, and processing strings, which are sequences of characters. These data structures are optimized to handle various string-related operations such as substring search, concatenation, insertion, deletion, and pattern matching efficiently. Here's a brief explanation of some common string data structures:


1. Trie (Prefix Tree): A trie is a tree-like data structure used for efficient storage and retrieval of a dynamic set of strings. Each node in the trie represents a single character, and paths from the root to the leaf nodes form complete strings. Tries are particularly useful for tasks such as dictionary implementations, autocomplete systems, and prefix-based searching.

2. Suffix Array: A suffix array is an array of all suffixes of a given string, sorted lexicographically. It is a compact data structure that allows efficient substring search and pattern matching operations, such as finding the longest common substring or locating occurrences of a pattern within a text.

3. Suffix Tree: A suffix tree is a compressed trie-like data structure representing all suffixes of a string. It provides fast substring search, pattern matching, and various string-related queries, making it useful for tasks like substring matching, string indexing, and bioinformatics applications.

4. Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT): The Burrows-Wheeler Transform is a reversible data transformation technique used to improve the efficiency of data compression algorithms, particularly for text compression. It rearranges the characters of a string to group similar characters together, making it easier to compress using techniques like Move-to-Front coding and Run-Length Encoding.
