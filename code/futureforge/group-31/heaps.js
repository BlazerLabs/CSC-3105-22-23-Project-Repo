// A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a heap, for a given node i, the value of its parent node is greater (or smaller) 
// than or equal to the value of i depending on whether it's a max heap or min heap. Heaps are commonly used in priority queues and heap sort algorithms.
