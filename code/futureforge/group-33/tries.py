# A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used for efficiently storing and retrieving a dynamic set of strings. Each node in a trie represents a single character of a string. 
# The structure of a trie allows for quick lookups and prefix-based searches. Tries are commonly used in applications involving autocomplete, spell checkers, and prefix matching.
