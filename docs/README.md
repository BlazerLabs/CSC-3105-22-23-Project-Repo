# Docs
Here are the documents the firms are to submit to complete the project.

## Guide for Use
1. Each firm is to work within the directory named similarly to that firm - so team @BlazerLabs/evergreen-dynamics will work within the /evergreen directory.
2. Please, _please_, **kindly create a branch before you do any commits.**
3. DO NOT PUSH to main. REPEAT - DO NOT EVER PUSH TO MAIN!!! THAT's MINE!!!
4. Push new commits to a branch first (not main).
