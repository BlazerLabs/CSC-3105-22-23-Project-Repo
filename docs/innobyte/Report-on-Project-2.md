# Project 2
**The following is a report on the work done by INNOBYTE LAB on a project assigned during CSC 3105 coursework in the 2022/23 session, as follows:**

## Question
Data structures complement algorithms in the way programs work, on account of their facility for organising and enabling access to data; thus, understanding data structures is fundamental to our knowledge and use of programs, irrespective of what paradigm is in play.
1. Each group in your corporation is to identify and describe ALL data structures used in programming.
2. Each group in your corporation is to attempt the development of these data structures as they can, in ONE programming language among Java, JS, PHP and Python.

## Response

# INNOBYTELABS Project Report:Identifying & Developing Data Structures in Programming

## Introduction
Data structures play a pivotal role in programming, complementing algorithms by organizing and facilitating access to data. Regardless of the programming paradigm in use, a solid understanding of data structures is fundamental for effective program development. This report outlines the efforts of each group within our corporation in identifying, describing, and attempting to develop various data structures using Java, JavaScript, PHP, or Python.

## Identifying Data Structures
As a firm we found out data structures including:
- Array
- tree
- graph,
- hashtable
- heap
- linkedlist
- queues
- maps
- sparse matrix
- set and
- stack.<br>

Each group within our corporation were tasked with describing this essential data structures used in programming.The description was sent to CEO and is contained in our doc file (still on this folder).
Each group members were tasked with developing atleast one of those data structure to make up for development of the found data structures across the groups.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, understanding data structures is crucial for proficient programming, as they serve as the backbone for organizing and accessing data efficiently. Through this project, each group in our corporation has gained valuable insights into various data structures and their implementations in programming languages, contributing to our collective knowledge and proficiency in software development.
