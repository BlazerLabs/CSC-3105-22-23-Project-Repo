Data Structures andtheir development in some common programming languages

The following is a report on the work done by ALGOMATRIX SOLUTIONS on a project assigned during CSC 3105 coursework in the 2022/23 session, as follows:

Question
1. Data structures complement algorithms in the way programs work, on account of their facility for organising and enabling access to data; thus, understanding data structures is fundamental to our knowledge and use of programs, irrespective of what paradigm is in play.

2. Each group in your corporation is to identify and describe ALL data structures used in programming.
Each group in your corporation is to attempt the development of these data structures as they can, in ONE programming language among Java, JS, PHP and Python.
