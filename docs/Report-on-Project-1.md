# Project 1
**The following is a report on the work done by YOUR_CORPORATION_NAME on the project assigned during CSC 3105 coursework in the 2022/23 session.**

## Question
You will define a UML-defined class hierarchy using the following concepts related to the idea of a social network app:

**Person, User, Connection, Group, Post, Media, Follower, Share, Reaction, Like.**

*(Let the names of these concepts reflect their real-world connotations within the application domain specified - that of a social network app.)*

Note that the connections between concepts in this hierarchy do not necessarily have to be all of the same kind, nor must they all be inheritance relations. However, each concept can just be one, and only one, of the following: a class, an abstract class or an interface.

Your tasks are as follows:
1. Draw up a UML class diagram describing this hierarchy. Show ALL properties, and up to 5 relevant methods. Do not include any getter OR setter methods.
2. Explain, in detail, your choices in defining this hierarchy, using a tabular form, as follows:

| S/No. | Concept A | Concept B | Relationship | Explanation |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
