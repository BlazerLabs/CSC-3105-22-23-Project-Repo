# Project 2
**The following is a report on the work done by YOUR_CORPORATION_NAME on a project assigned during CSC 3105 coursework in the 2022/23 session, as follows:**

## Question
Data structures complement algorithms in the way programs work, on account of their facility for organising and enabling access to data; thus, understanding data structures is fundamental to our knowledge and use of programs, irrespective of what paradigm is in play.
1. Each group in your corporation is to identify and describe ALL data structures used in programming.
2. Each group in your corporation is to attempt the development of these data structures as they can, in ONE programming language among Java, JS, PHP and Python.

# Project Report: Data Structures Discovery and Implementation

## 1. Introduction

In this project, we set out to explore and implement various fundamental data structures commonly used in programming. Initially, we conducted research to discover and understand nine key data structures essential for organizing and managing data efficiently. Subsequently, each group was tasked with working on all nine discovered data structures, utilizing different programming languages. This report details our discoveries, explanations of each data structure, and the implementation process.

## 2. Data Structures Discovered

The following nine data structures were discovered and explored as part of this project:

1. Arrays
2. Linked Lists
3. Stacks
4. Queues
5. Trees
6. Heaps
7. Hash Tables
8. Graphs
9. Tries

Each data structure serves a unique purpose and offers specific functionalities, making them indispensable components of software development.

### Explanation of Data Structures

- **Arrays:** Arrays are linear data structures used to store a collection of elements. Each element in an array is accessed using a numeric index. Arrays can be static or dynamic in size and can hold elements of any data type.

- **Linked Lists:** Linked lists are linear data structures consisting of nodes where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have indices, and elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations.

- **Stacks:** Stacks are linear data structures that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack. Common operations include push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and size.

- **Queues:** Queues are linear data structures that follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front of the queue. Common operations include enqueue, dequeue, front, isEmpty, and size.

- **Trees:** Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each node has a parent and zero or more children. Common types of trees include binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced trees.

- **Heaps:** Heaps are tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property. Common types of heaps include binary heaps and priority queues.

- **Hash Tables:** Hash tables are data structures that store key-value pairs, allowing for efficient retrieval of values based on keys. They use a hash function to map keys to indices in an array.

- **Graphs:** Graphs are non-linear data structures consisting of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. They are used to represent networks and relationships between entities.

- **Tries:** Tries (also known as prefix trees) are tree-based data structures used for efficient retrieval of strings. They are commonly used in applications such as autocomplete and spell checkers.

## 3. Group Assignments and Implementation

Each group was assigned to work on all nine discovered data structures, utilizing different programming languages for implementation. The groups conducted research, , developed code structures, implemented core functionalities, and conducted extensive testing to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the implementations.

## 4. Conclusion

Through collaborative efforts, the project provided valuable insights into the design and implementation of fundamental data structures in software development. Team members gained hands-on experience in modeling, coding, and testing data structures, enhancing their understanding of algorithmic concepts and programming methodologies. The implemented data structures serve as valuable assets for future projects, contributing to the development of efficient and scalable software solutions.
